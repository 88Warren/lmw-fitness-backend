      Lets discuss your <strong>mindset</strong>. You can follow the <em>perfect</em> programme, eat the <em>right</em> foods and <em>train</em> consistently,
      but if your head isn’t in the game, progress can stall.

    <h3>
      Ditch All-or-Nothing Thinking
    </h3>
    <p>
      One missed workout or “bad” meal doesn’t undo everything. 
      It’s about the bigger picture and the <strong>habits you build day by day</strong>.

    <h3>
      Celebrate Progress, Not Perfection
    </h3>
    <p>
      Celebrate the small wins:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Lifting heavier</li>
      <li>Doing an extra rep</li>
      <li>Feeling more energetic</li>
      <li>Sleeping better</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These little victories stack up and keep you motivated far more than fixating on the scale ever will.

    <h3>
      Be Kind to Yourself
    </h3>
    <p>
      Tough days happen and that’s okay. Talk to yourself like you’d talk to a friend, encouraging, not critical.

      So, next time you’re feeling stuck, take a deep breath, reset your focus and show up for yourself. 
      Fitness is as much about mental strength as physical strength and with the right mindset, 
      you can absolutely crush your goals.
