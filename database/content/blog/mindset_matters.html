<h2>Your Mindset Matters More Than You Think</h2>
<p>Hi, it’s Laura! I want to talk about something that gets overlooked way too often in fitness: your mindset. You can follow the perfect programme, eat the right foods and train consistently – but if your head isn’t in the game, progress can stall.</p>
<p>The first step is ditching all-or-nothing thinking. One missed workout or “bad” meal doesn’t undo everything. It’s about the bigger picture and the habits you build day by day.</p>
<p>Next, focus on progress, not perfection. Celebrate the small wins – lifting heavier, doing an extra rep, feeling more energetic, sleeping better. These little victories stack up and they keep you motivated far more than fixating on the scale ever will.</p>
<p>Finally, remember to be kind to yourself. Tough days happen and that’s okay. Talk to yourself like you’d talk to a friend – encouraging, not critical. Your mindset shapes your actions and your actions shape your results.</p>
<p>So, next time you’re feeling stuck, take a deep breath, reset your focus and show up for yourself. Fitness is as much about mental strength as physical strength – and with the right mindset, you can absolutely crush your goals.</p>
