    <h1>If Not Now, Then When? Welcome to LMW Fitness!</h1>
  </header>
  
  <p>
    Hi, I'm Laura and I can't tell you how excited I am to finally share my brand new website with you! 
    This little corner of the internet has been a long time coming and it's where I'll be bringing you everything LMW Fitness stands for.
    I'll be motivating you through your journey.
    I will help you in making fitness accessible in your busy life and give you plenty of encouragement.
    Helping you feel fitter, stronger and more confident in your own skin.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    So, why now? Well, my motto has always been 
    <strong>“If not now, then when?”</strong> 
    and I know how easy it is to keep putting off the changes we know we want to make. 
    Life gets busy and suddenly weeks, months and even years can fly by. 
    But our health and wellbeing can't be shoved to the bottom of the to-do list forever. 
    That’s where I come in.

    <h3>A Bit About Me</h3>
    <p>
      For those of you who don't know me, I'm a qualified personal trainer and ex-British Army physical training instructor. 
      I've been coaching people for years, trying out all sorts of methods and learning what really works. 
      Let me tell you it's not about endless hours in the gym or extreme diets. 
      It's about time efficient workouts, building healthy habits and finding something that fits into your lifestyle, not the other way round.
    </p>
    <p>
      I set up LMW Fitness because I genuinely believe fitness should be accessible to everyone, no matter how hectic your schedule. 
      I want to prove that you can make a big difference with short, structured sessions and a positive mindset.

    <h3>My New 30-Day Fat Loss Programme</h3>
    <p>
      One of the things I'm most excited about on my new site is the <strong>30-Day Beginner and advanced Programmes</strong>. 
      This is for anyone who's ready to commit but doesn't have hours to spare each day. 
      Here's how it works: you get a workout video from me every single day for 30 days. 
      You can do it at home, in the gym, in the garden, wherever you like. 
      You don't need fancy kit, just a bit of space and the willingness to show up for yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The best bit? You're never on your own. 
      Each video guides you through exactly what to do and I'm right there cheering you on (yes, even through the screen!).

    <h3>Why I Love What I Do</h3>
    <p>
      The thing that keeps me motivated is seeing people achieve things they never thought possible. 
      Whether it's someone who's just completed their very first press up or someone who's found the confidence to step into a gym for the first time, those wins are huge. 
      I love being part of that journey, offering not just workouts but encouragement and a bit of tough love when needed.
