<h2>5 Top Tips to Stay Motivated With Your Training</h2>
<p>Hi, it’s Laura! Let’s be honest – staying motivated with training isn’t always easy. Some days the sofa wins, the weather’s rubbish, or life just gets in the way. I’ve been there, and I’ve helped countless clients through it too. Here are my top 5 tips to keep your motivation fired up:</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        <strong>Set realistic goals</strong> – Big, vague targets like “get fit” are hard to track. Break it down into small, achievable milestones you can actually celebrate.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Find your ‘why’</strong> – Why are you training? More energy? Confidence? Better health? Keep that reason front and centre; it’ll pull you through tough days.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Mix it up</strong> – Variety keeps training fun. Switch between strength, cardio, and mobility – or try a new class. Boredom is motivation’s worst enemy.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Track your progress</strong> – Photos, notes, even just ticking off your workout calendar. Seeing how far you’ve come is hugely motivating.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Reward yourself (without guilt!)</strong> – Small treats, a new training top, or a long walk in the sunshine. Positive reinforcement keeps the fire alive.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>Motivation will always ebb and flow, but with these strategies, you’ll have the tools to keep going even when the sofa looks tempting. Show up for yourself – you’ll be glad you did!</p>
