<h2>Why Recovery is Just as Important as Your Workout</h2>
<p>Hi, it’s Laura! We all love a good sweat session, but here’s the thing: recovery is just as important as the training itself. You can’t build strength, lose fat, or feel energised if you’re constantly running on empty.</p>
<p>Recovery isn’t just about taking a day off. It’s about giving your body the tools it needs to repair and get stronger. Stretching, foam rolling, mobility work and even gentle walks all count. Sleep is your superpower – missing out slows progress and leaves you more prone to injury.</p>
<p>Another big one? Nutrition. Refuelling after a workout with protein, carbs and fluids helps your muscles recover and keeps energy levels stable. And let’s not forget mental recovery: taking time to switch off, breathe and reset is just as crucial as your physical rest.</p>
<p>Remember, fitness isn’t about punishing yourself every day. It’s about balance. Show up, work hard and then give your body the love it deserves. Recovery days aren’t a weakness – they’re a smart move that makes every workout more effective.</p>
<p>Take care of your body and it will take care of you. You’ll get stronger, fitter and feel amazing – promise!</p>
