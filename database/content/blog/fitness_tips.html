<h2>10 Fitness Tips You’re Probably Overlooking (But Shouldn’t!)</h2>
<p>Hi, it’s Laura here! I thought I’d share some of the little things that often get forgotten when people start a new fitness journey.</p>
<p>These are my go-to fitness tips – the ones people often skip over but that make a huge difference in the long run...</p>
<p>Think of these as the “unsexy” habits that keep everything ticking along. They might not be glamorous, but they’re absolute game-changers if you want results that actually last.</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        <strong>Sleep is king</strong> – No amount of burpees will make up for five hours of broken sleep. Your body repairs and gets stronger when you’re out cold, so make rest a priority.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Drink more water</strong> – Coffee doesn’t count! Dehydration makes you sluggish and zaps your energy, so keep a bottle handy.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Warm up properly</strong> – A quick wiggle of the arms doesn’t cut it. A proper warm-up gets your body ready and drastically reduces the risk of injury.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Don’t skip rest days</strong> – Rest is where the magic happens. Training hard every single day without recovery is a fast track to burnout.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Form first, weight second</strong> – Lifting heavier isn’t impressive if your technique’s a mess. Master the move before piling on the kilos.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Consistency beats intensity</strong> – One epic workout a month won’t do much. Small, regular efforts win every time.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Protein matters</strong> – If you want to tone up, you need protein. Think chicken, fish, beans, tofu – whatever works for you.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Mix it up</strong> – Doing the same workout on repeat is boring for you and your body. Variety keeps things fresh.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Track your progress</strong> – Progress pics, training notes, even ticking off a calendar. It’s a brilliant motivator.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Mindset is everything</strong> – Motivation is fickle, but discipline will carry you through. Be kind to yourself on the tough days and celebrate the wins.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>So, be honest – which of these have you been guilty of skipping???</p>
