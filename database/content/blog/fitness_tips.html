      Think of these as the <strong>“unsexy” </strong>habits that keep everything ticking along.

    <h3>The 10 Tips</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Sleep is king</strong><br />
        No amount of burpees will make up for five hours of broken sleep. 
        Your body repairs and gets stronger when you’re out cold, so make rest a priority.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Drink more water</strong><br />
        Coffee doesn’t count! Dehydration makes you sluggish and zaps your energy, so keep a bottle handy.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Warm up properly</strong><br />
        A quick wiggle of the arms doesn’t cut it. 
        A proper warm-up gets your body ready and drastically reduces the risk of injury.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Don’t skip rest days</strong><br />
        Rest is where the magic happens. 
        Training hard every single day without recovery is a fast track to burnout.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Form first, weight second</strong><br />
        Lifting heavier isn’t impressive if your technique’s a mess.
        Master the move before piling on the kilos.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Consistency beats intensity</strong><br />
        One epic workout a month won’t do much.
        Small, regular efforts win every time.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Protein matters</strong><br />
        If you want to tone up, you need protein. 
        Think chicken, fish, beans, tofu, whatever works for you.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Mix it up</strong><br />
        Doing the same workout on repeat is boring for you and your body. 
        Variety keeps things fresh.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Track your progress</strong><br />
        Progress pics, training notes, even ticking off a calendar. 
        It’s a brilliant motivator.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Mindset is everything</strong><br />
        Motivation is fickle, but discipline will carry you through. 
        Be kind to yourself on the tough days and celebrate the wins.
      </li>
    </ol>
