<h2>5 Nutrition Tips That Actually Make a Difference</h2>
<p>Hi, it’s Laura! Let’s chat about food – because training hard without fuelling properly is like putting cheap petrol in a Ferrari. Here are my top 5 nutrition tips for keeping your energy up, supporting your training and managing weight without the faff.</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        <strong>Protein is your best mate</strong> – It helps muscles repair and keeps you fuller for longer. Eggs, chicken, lentils, tofu – mix it up and get some in every meal.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Don’t fear carbs</strong> – They’re your body’s main fuel source. Just go for the good stuff: oats, wholegrain rice, potatoes. They’ll keep your workouts powered and stop those 4pm biscuit raids.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Hydrate like you mean it</strong> – Water first, coffee second. Dehydration sneaks up and makes you feel tired and snacky. Keep a bottle nearby and sip throughout the day.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Colour your plate</strong> – Fruit and veg aren’t just garnish. Aim for a rainbow – the variety means more vitamins, minerals, and fibre, all helping you recover and stay healthy.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Balance, not restriction</strong> – Cutting out everything you love never lasts. Enjoy the chocolate, glass of wine, or takeaway – just not all at once, every day!
    </li>
</ol>

<p>Simple, sustainable, and way more effective than fad diets. Food is fuel – so fuel well!</p>
