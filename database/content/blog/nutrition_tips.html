    Let’s chat about food because training hard without fuelling properly is like putting cheap petrol in a Ferrari. 
  </p>

  <p>
    Here are my top 5 nutrition tips for keeping your energy up, supporting your training and managing weight without the faff.
  </p>

  <h3>The 5 Tips</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Protein is your best mate</strong><br />
      It helps muscles repair and keeps you fuller for longer. Eggs, chicken, lentils, tofu, mix it up and get some in every meal.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Don’t fear carbs</strong><br />
      They’re your body’s main fuel source. Just go for the good stuff: oats, wholegrain rice, potatoes. 
      They’ll keep your workouts powered and stop those 4pm biscuit raids.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Hydrate like you mean it</strong><br />
      Water first, coffee second. Dehydration sneaks up and makes you feel tired and snacky. 
      Keep a bottle nearby and sip throughout the day.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Colour your plate</strong><br />
      Fruit and veg aren’t just garnish. 
      Aim for a rainbow, the variety means more vitamins, minerals and fibre, all helping you recover and stay healthy.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Balance, not restriction</strong><br />
      Cutting out everything you love never lasts. 
      Enjoy the chocolate, glass of wine or takeaway, just not all at once, every day!
    </li>
  </ol>
